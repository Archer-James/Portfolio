Welcome to My Portfolio
This portfolio highlights the work I've completed during my time at UNCW, including coursework and independent projects. It features projects in HTML, Java, Python, GUI development, and culminates in my Honors Thesis, The Seahawk Vault â€” a full-stack web application and research project focused on digital memory preservation.

Each project reflects my growth as a developer and my passion for building meaningful, user-focused technology.
